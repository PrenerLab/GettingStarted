There are a number of initial steps for getting set-up with the tools we use for research. These allow us to conduct our research in an ethical, secure, and reproducible manner.

### CITI Training
Since we work with data that includes information about people, we need to take extra steps to make sure that we protect participants' rights. One step in that is taking a short research ethics training course through the [CITI program](https://www.citiprogram.org). When you register, you will need to affiliate yourself with Saint Louis University and take the "Social/Behavioral Research" course. You can find out more details on this program on [SLU's Institutional Review Board website](http://goo.gl/Dzu9E6). Once you have completed your course, forward your completion certificate to Chris.

### Two-Factor Authentication
You'll notice a bunch of references to "two-factor authentication" below. Sometimes it gets abbreviated it as "2FA". Two-factor authentication prevents an authorized user from accessing an account even if they have the correct password. It does this by requiring a second piece of information beyond the password to log-in, typically a six-digit code that is sent via text message to you.

Websites use this differently - Google requires the second factor be entered every thirty days or at a log-in from a new device while other services only require the second factor when a new device is used to log-in.

Speaking of Google, you can and should set-up two-factor authentication on your SLU Google account. You can follow [these instructions](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/) to enable it.

The mySLU system does not currently have two-factor authentication set-up. The University is [rolling out](http://www.slu.edu/its/password-help/login2-slu) a system that they are calling "multi-factor authentication" for Fall, 2017. Based on their current plans, it is a similar set-up to the services we use for research - you would need your phone or another device (like a small application running in the background on your computer) to log-in to the mySLU system. You can start the registration process now by following the instructions on the [SLU ITS website](http://www.slu.edu/its/password-help/login2-slu).

### Web Services for Collaborating
We use a number of different services to collaborate on documents and code. If you already have accounts with these services, great! If not, you can sign-up for free.

#### Dropbox
We use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) for storing project files that are not directly related to data analysis work.

Don't have a Dropbox account yet? Ask us to invite you (inviting you gets one of our team members more storage space)! Once you have an account, let Chris know the email address associated with it and we'll invite you to our shared folder.

Once you have an account, you'll want to install the [Dropbox desktop client](https://www.dropbox.com/install) for your computer so that files are automatically kept in sync.

Whether or not you are new to Dropbox, you'll also want to turn on [two-factor authentication](https://www.dropbox.com/help/363) for Dropbox. If you've been a Dropbox member for awhile (since before 2012), you should also change your password.

After Chris invites you to our shared folders, they will automatically appear on your computer's hard drive (assuming you have the desktop client downloaded and installed). When changes are made to those files by someone else, they'll automatically update on your computer as well.

#### Slack
We use [Slack](https://slack.com) to keep in touch. I try to meet with folks once a week or every other week, depending on what they are working on. We also try to meet as a group a couple of times a semester. In the meantime, Slack helps us stay in touch and helps keep the rest of the team in the loop with what we are working on.

Ask Chris for an invitation to sign-up for our team. Once the sign-up process is complete, you can log-in by going to our team's [Slack site](https://prenerlab.slack.com). Fill out your profile, set-up [two-factor authentication](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication), and change your timezone. Make sure you join the channels for the research projects you are involved in!

Once you are logged-in to Slack, check out their [Slack Guides](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/202622877-Slack-Guides) for tutorials on everything Slack related. The [Getting Started for New Users](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users) guide might be particularly helpful.

#### Trello
We use [Trello](https://trello.com) to keep track of who is working on what. We have a number of virtual boards that we have lists of cards attached to - these have ideas, checklists, and reminders on them.

Ask Chris for an invitation for join our team. Once the sign-up process is complete, you can log-in by going to [trello.com](https://trello.com). Fill our your profile and set-up [two-factor authentication](http://help.trello.com/article/993-enabling-two-factor-authentication-for-your-trello-account).

To get a quick introduction to how Trello works, check out the "Welcome Board" that they automatically generate for you when you create your account. You can also check out their [Getting Started with Trello](https://trello.com/guide) guides. The [Organize](https://trello.com/guide/organize.html) and [Board Basics](https://trello.com/guide/board_basics.html) guides might be particularly helpful.

### Web Services for Data Analysis

#### GitHub.com
We use [GitHub](https://github.com) (you're here right now!) for collaborating on datasets, code, and research documentation. We like GitHub because it tracks our changes and makes it easy for a bunch of people to work on a single project. We also like (love?) GitHub because it makes our data analyses more reproducible. If you are going to work on any coding or data analysis with us, you'll need a GitHub account.

You can sign-up at [GitHub.com](https://github.com). Once you've signed up, fill out your profile, set-up [two-factor authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/), and let Chris know what your username is. Once he has it, he can add you to the [PrenerLab](https://github.com/PrenerLab) organization.

Once you have an account, you'll want to install the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com) for your computer so that you can clone the repositories that you are working, make changes, and keep your work in sync with the rest of the team.

To get a quick introduction to how GitHub works, check out the their [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com). The [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and the [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) guides may be particularly helpful. I highly recommend completing the [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) exercise as well. We also have our [own guide](https://github.com/PrenerLab/GettingStarted/blob/master/gitHubGuide.md) for how we use GitHub.

This interactive [Git Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) was created by Code School, it does a good job of explaining Git, the processes behind GitHub. It can be especially useful for helping users understand what is occurring when we push a branch or submit a pull request. It takes about 15 minutes or less and upon completion offers other interactive tutorials to learn more.
