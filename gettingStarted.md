## Web Services
We use a number of different services to collaborate on documents and code. If you already have accounts with these services, great! If not, you can sign-up for free.

### Dropbox
We use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) for storing project files that are not directly related to data analysis work.

Don't have a Dropbox account yet? Ask us to invite you (inviting you gets one of our team members more storage space)! Once you have an account, let Chris know the email address associated with it and we'll invite you to our shared folder.

Once you have an account, you'll want to install the [Dropbox desktop client](https://www.dropbox.com/install) for your computer so that files are automatically kept in sync.

Whether or not you are new to Dropbox, you'll also want to turn on [two-factor authentication](https://www.dropbox.com/help/363) for Dropbox. If you've been a Dropbox member for awhile (since before 2012), you should also change your password.

### GitHub.com
We use [GitHub](https://github.com) (you're here right now!) for collaborating on datasets, code, and research documentation. We like GitHub because it tracks our changes and makes it easy for a bunch of people to work on a single project. We also like (love?) GitHub because it makes our data analyses more reproducible.

You can sign-up at [GitHub.com](https://github.com). Once you've signed up, fill out your profile, set-up [two-factor authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/), and let Chris know what your username is. Once he has it, he can add you to the [PrenerLab](https://github.com/PrenerLab) organization.

Once you have an account, you'll want to install the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com) for your computer so that you can clone the repositories that you are working, make changes, and keep your work in sync with the rest of the team.

### Slack
We use [Slack](https://slack.com) to keep in touch. It is hard to have regular research meetings that work for a bunch of people with very busy schedules. I try to meet with folks once a week or every other week, depending on what they are working on. In the meantime, Slack helps us stay in touch and helps keep the rest of the team in the loop with what we are working on.

Ask Chris for an invitation to sign-up for our team. Once the sign-up process is complete, you can log-in by going to our team's [Slack site](https://prenerlab.slack.com). Fill out your profile, set-up [two-factor authentication](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication), and change your timezone. Make sure you join the channels for the research projects you are involved in!
